							One of the great things about language learning is that there are so many engaging ways to develop  
							your skills. If you want to practice your Spanish comprehension skills, podcasts are a great way to learn  
							and immerse yourself without using much mental energy. Podcasts are wonderful because you can  
							listen to them while doing other simple tasks that aren’t too mentally demanding; cleaning, driving,  
							gaming, exercising, and so on. This makes Spanish podcasts a great learning tool for all learners, but  
							especially for those who don’t want to devote a lot of time and effort into language learning.

					<p>
						There are two things that make this podcast unique. Firstly, while this is a language learning podcast,  
						there are no lessons and there isn’t any teaching of language concepts. Duolingo uses stories to help the  
						listener practice their Spanish comprehension. The second thing that makes this podcast unique is that  
						it’s a bilingual podcast. In these episodes, we hear the storyteller speaking to us with a clearer and  
						slightly slower Spanish than the casual Spanish that native speakers might typically use. But the episodes  
						are designed to be learning tools, so we also receive lots of context in English. This context is very  
						effective because it summarizes the main ideas, explains foreign concepts, and teaches vocab that  
						listeners are likely not familiar with. 
					</p>
					<p>
						You don’t have to know a lot of Spanish to understand the episodes, so both novice and advanced 
						Spanish learners can learn a lot from this podcast. I would estimate that someone who has taken
						Spanish 1 and Spanish 2 would know enough to piece together some of the Spanish, but even if you
						don’t have that much experience, I recommend that you give this podcast a listen.

				<!--No Hay Tos Podcast-->
				<h5 class="smalldivider">No Hay Tos</h5>
				<div class="textsection">
					<p>
						This podcasts is mostly going to be for more advanced Spanish learners who know enough Spanish to  
						understand basic conversations. Bonus points if you’re trying to learn more Mexican Spanish because
						this podcast is made by two Mexicans (Roberto & Héctor) who enjoy sharing and talking about a wide
						variety of topics. In many of their episodes, they talk about their experiences and share some aspects of 
						their culture. They also have special episodes in which they do some teaching rather than engaging in 
						their typical conversations. Some of these episodes are dedicated to clearing up certain Spanish
						concepts that English speakers struggle with, while others teach you how to use certain expressions. 
						Roberto and Héctor are teachers who have taught Spanish and English classes and who have a focus on
						improving the Spanish of their listeners, so all of their episodes are created with Spanish learners in
						mind.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since No Hay Tos uses Spanish that is more conversational and conventional than Duolingo’s storyteller
						Spanish, listeners can immerse themselves in the more casual and common Spanish that native speakers 
						use regularly. For those who are interested in watching videos that provide visual context, Roberto and 
						Héctor also post their podcasts in video form on YouTube.
