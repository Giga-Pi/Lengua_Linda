					One of the great things about language learning is that there are so many engaging ways to develop  
					your skills. If you want to practice your Spanish comprehension skills, podcasts are a great way to learn  
					and immerse yourself without using much mental energy. Podcasts are wonderful because you can  
					listen to them while doing other simple tasks that aren’t too mentally demanding; cleaning, driving,  
					gaming, exercising, and so on. This makes Spanish podcasts a great learning tool for all learners, but  
					especially for those who don’t want to devote a lot of time and effort into language learning.   
				</p>
				
				<h5 class="smalldivider">Duolingo Spanish Podcast</h5>
				
				<p>
					There are two things that make this podcast unique. Firstly, while this is a language learning podcast,  
					there are no lessons and there isn’t any teaching of language concepts. Duolingo uses stories to help the  
					listener practice their Spanish comprehension. The second thing that makes this podcast unique is that  
					it’s a bilingual podcast. In these episodes, we hear the storyteller speaking to us with a clearer and  
					slightly slower Spanish than the casual Spanish that native speakers might typically use. But the episodes  
					are designed to be learning tools, so we also receive lots of context in English. This context is very  
					effective because it summarizes the main ideas, explains foreign concepts, and teaches vocab that  
					listeners are likely not familiar with. 
				</p>
				<p>
					But I get that not everyone has that drive for languages, or at least not all the time. That’s why I want to 
					share my passion with you and try to help you see what I see. I believe that the main reason that I kept 
					up with Spanish all this time is because the learning process was enjoyable for me. I believe that learning 
					a language can be and should be an enjoyable experience for everyone. That’s why I’m using this site to 
					showcase some of the awesome resources I enjoy most.

			¡Hola! ¿Qué onda? ¡Bienvenido a mi sitio de web! My name is Jonathan, but my friends usually call me Jonny. 
			All the pictures you see up there are of me and they are from my most recent trip to Europe. But obviously, 
			that’s probably not what you’re here for! 
		</p>
		<p>
			What’s the hype with Spanish anyway? Well, I started to take Spanish classes when I was a freshman in 
			high school in 2014 and I quickly found a passion and interest in languages. That’s why I ended up taking 
			Spanish classes for all four years of high school, and since I didn’t want to be one of the many people 
			who forget the language they took in high school, I continued to practice after the classes ended.

	<div class="textsection">
		<p>
			For those of you who really want to know more about me, this section is for you. A big part of my 
			identity is my Polish family background. Both of my parents lived in Poland before leaving everything 
			behind for a life in the United States. As a child of two Polish parents, I struggled to learn English when I 
			started attending school in the US. Unfortunately, I didn’t even manage to attain a competent level of 
			biliteracy after going through that struggle as I am not able to carry any real or meaningful conversations in Polish.
		</p>
		<p>
			I would say that my English has been at a native level since late elementary school, and while I 
			understand a lot of Polish, I find it difficult to express my ideas through it. Interestingly, I have tried to 
			learn more Polish but I’m not consistent with it. In fact, I spend infinitely more time trying to learn 
			Spanish than Polish. I probably put so much time into Spanish is because, unlike Polish, there are many 
			resources that are available and it’s easy to learn if you’re an English speaker. Either way I should 
			probably pick up the slack, my Polish ancestors are probably shaking their heads right now. 
		</p>
		<p>
			As you can probably tell from my last picture, I usually don’t like to take myself too seriously. I’m relatively 
			carefree and relaxed, and I enjoy being around people. When I’m alone, I like to spend time doing things 
			that interest me, and there are a lot of things that interest me. Of course, one of those things is 
			language learning, but I also enjoy working on my car, playing games like Skyrim, working on this 
			website, going to the gym, and making/playing music.
