						¡Hola! ¿Qué onda? ¡Bienvenido a mi sitio de web! My name is Jonathan, but my friends usually call me Jonny. 
						All the pictures you see up there are of me and they are from my most recent trip to Europe. But obviously, 
						that’s probably not what you’re here for! 
					</p>
					<p>
						What’s the hype with Spanish anyway? Well, I started to take Spanish classes when I was a freshman in 
						high school in 2014 and I quickly found a passion and interest in languages. That’s why I ended up taking 
						Spanish classes for all four years of high school, and since I didn’t want to be one of the many people 
						who forget the language they took in high school, I continued to practice after the classes ended.
					</p>
					<p>
						But I get that not everyone has that drive for languages, or at least not all the time. That’s why I want to 
						share my passion with you and try to help you see what I see. I believe that the main reason that I kept 
						up with Spanish all this time is because the learning process was enjoyable for me. I believe that learning 
						a language can be and should be an enjoyable experience for everyone. That’s why I’m using this site to 
						showcase some of the awesome resources I enjoy most.

					<p>
						For those of you who really want to know more about me, this section is for you. A big part of my 
						identity is my Polish family background. Both of my parents lived in Poland before leaving everything 
						behind for a life in the United States. As a child of two Polish parents, I struggled to learn English when I 
						started attending school in the US. Unfortunately, I didn’t even manage to attain a competent level of 
						biliteracy after going through that struggle as I am not able to carry any real or meaningful conversations in Polish.
					</p>
					<p>
						I would say that my English has been at a native level since late elementary school, and while I 
						understand a lot of Polish, I find it difficult to express my ideas through it. Interestingly, I have tried to 
						learn more Polish but I’m not consistent with it. In fact, I spend infinitely more time trying to learn 
						Spanish than Polish. I probably put so much time into Spanish is because, unlike Polish, there are many 
						resources that are available and it’s easy to learn if you’re an English speaker. Either way I should 
						probably pick up the slack, my Polish ancestors are probably shaking their heads right now. 
					</p>
					<p>
						As you can probably tell from my last picture, I usually don’t like to take myself too seriously. I’m relatively 
						carefree and relaxed, and I enjoy being around people. When I’m alone, I like to spend time doing things 
						that interest me, and there are a lot of things that interest me. Of course, one of those things is 
						language learning, but I also enjoy working on my car, playing games like Skyrim, working on this 
						website, going to the gym, and making/playing music.
